# Rails Cheats

This repo is a collection of guides I have created during my web development training.

I will post the gists here as well as on my blog codealchemy.io, by you can also check out the wiki attached to this repo for more information as well, though some of it may just be train of thought insanity. 

Topics:

1. Starting a Rails Project
2. Rails Generators
3. Creating Routes
4. Controllers
5. Testing with Capybara
6. Testing with Rspec
7. Understanding MultiTenancy
